\title{R binding for computing non-negative matrix factorizations using CUDA}
\description{
R binding for the libary \emph{libnmfgpu} which can be used to compute non-negative matrix factorizations using CUDA hardware
acceleration.
}
\details{
The main function to use is \code{\link{nmfgpu}} which can be configured using various arguments.
In addition to it a few helper functions are provided, but they aren't necessary for using \code{\link{nmfgpu}}.
